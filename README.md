# SAS Customer Intelligence 360 - Sample Mobile Apps

## Overview
SAS CI360 Sample Mobile Apps provide working examples on how to utilize our iOS and Android native SDKs in hybrid framework mobile apps. This repository contains a number of mobile apps for different platforms/frameworks that are ready to be used by mobile app developers to experience how our SDK supports non-native mobile app frameworks. In addition, these sample mobile apps can be used for debugging/troubleshooting purposes.
